Stationarity Tests
==================

ADF Test for Currency in Circulation
------------------------
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test checks for stationarity.
Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (non-stationary).
Alternative Hypothesis: The series is stationary.

Test Statistic: -0.3670
p-value: 0.9155
Interpretation: p-value > 0.05: Fail to reject null hypothesis - series is non-stationary

Critical Values:
1%: -3.4875
5%: -2.8866
10%: -2.5801

Comparison: If test statistic < critical value, reject null hypothesis.

ADF Test for Repo Rate
------------------------
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test checks for stationarity.
Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (non-stationary).
Alternative Hypothesis: The series is stationary.

Test Statistic: -1.8710
p-value: 0.3458
Interpretation: p-value > 0.05: Fail to reject null hypothesis - series is non-stationary

Critical Values:
1%: -3.4880
5%: -2.8868
10%: -2.5802

Comparison: If test statistic < critical value, reject null hypothesis.

ADF Test for CPI Inflation Rate
------------------------
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test checks for stationarity.
Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (non-stationary).
Alternative Hypothesis: The series is stationary.

Test Statistic: -1.4208
p-value: 0.5723
Interpretation: p-value > 0.05: Fail to reject null hypothesis - series is non-stationary

Critical Values:
1%: -3.4930
5%: -2.8890
10%: -2.5814

Comparison: If test statistic < critical value, reject null hypothesis.

ADF Test for Currency in Circulation
------------------------
The Augmented Dickey-Fuller test checks for stationarity.
Null Hypothesis: The series has a unit root (non-stationary).
Alternative Hypothesis: The series is stationary.

Test Statistic: -0.3670
p-value: 0.9155
Interpretation: p-value > 0.05: Fail to reject null hypothesis - series is non-stationary

Critical Values:
1%: -3.4875
5%: -2.8866
10%: -2.5801

Comparison: If test statistic < critical value, reject null hypothesis.


Note: Currency in Circulation was non-stationary, so first differences were used.
Model Diagnostics
==================
These tests check if the model residuals are well-behaved (white noise).

1. Ljung-Box Test for Autocorrelation:
Null Hypothesis: No autocorrelation in residuals.
Test Statistic: 13.7568
p-value: 0.1844
Interpretation: No significant autocorrelation (good)

2. Jarque-Bera Test for Normality:
Null Hypothesis: Residuals are normally distributed.
Test Statistic: 18401.3378
p-value: 0.0000
Interpretation: Residuals not normally distributed (problematic)

3. ARCH Test for Heteroskedasticity:
Null Hypothesis: No ARCH effects (constant variance).
Test Statistic: 0.1521
p-value: 1.0000
Interpretation: No ARCH effects (good)
